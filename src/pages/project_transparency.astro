    <p>
      Rehabilitative robotics, particularly lower-limb exoskeletons (LLEs), have gained increasing importance in aiding
      patients regain ambulatory functions. One of the challenges in making these systems effective is the implementation of an assist-as-needed (AAN) 
      control strategy that intervenes only when the patient deviates from the correct movement pattern. Equally
      crucial is the need for the LLE to exhibit "transparency" - minimizing its interaction forces with the wearer to feel as
      natural as possible. </br></br>
      We introduce a novel approach to transparency control based on a human-in-the-loop velocity optimization framework. The proposed method employs torque
      data captured from past steps through a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) to approximate the wearer's intended future movements and computes a corresponding transparent velocity trajectory.
      The velocity commands are complemented by an Adaptive Frequency Oscillator (AFO) based position controller that leverages the periodic nature of human gait and is modified with a force
      sensor for increased reactiveness to human gait variations. This approach is experimentally evaluated against a standard zero-torque controller with a stationary single-degree-of-freedom 
      knee exoskeleton test platform in a proof-of-concept study. Preliminary results indicate that combining adaptive oscillators with interaction force sensing can improve transparency 
      compared to the conventional zero-torque controller, using force readings for position control and torque measurements for velocity optimization and control.
      </br></br>
      The diagram below shows the control framework that includes the AFO for the position computation and the velocity optimisation for the velocity computation.
